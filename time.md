Software used:
-Visual Studio Code
-XAMPP
-Apache Web Server
-PHP plugin
-HTML plugin
-CSS plugin

What I did:
-Each of the three tasks were similar to other tasks I had completed on CodeWars, LeetCode etc. so it was not techically difficult
-Due to hardware and software constraints, I run on and old Mac at the moment, I was unable to download/utilise Composer or Dcoker
-for the Symfony framework, whihc limits me greatly
-I spent about 2 hours doing the coding for all three tasks
-1 hour making it look semi-decent styling with HTML/CSS
-3 hours installing the right software in the first place (aforementioned bad Mac that I am using)
-30 mins creating documentation, updating and commiting to GitHub
-20 minutes making various cups of tea (I had 3)
-30 minutes making and consuming Ramen
-I did have fun
