Engineer Task for Jadu - PHP - instructions by Faizan Anwar

-You can download this file, or, copy/paste this into an Editor such as Visual Studio Code or Brackets. I used VS Code, available here:
-https://code.visualstudio.com/download
-This was developed in PHP and HTML
-And relies on the local server service provided by XAMPP - which is for testing - which can be downloaded below:
-https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
-Upon downloading and installing both, create a new folder in the folder structure shown below:
-(yourPC)/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/(YOURNEWFOLDER)
-Open up this new folder in VS Code/Brackets and create a new file called check2.php, paste the source code here
OR
-paste the PHP file into your new folder
-Open XAMPP, click on Manage Servers and 'Start' Apache Web Server
-open your browser, type: http://localhost/YOURNEWFOLDER/check2.php
-freely edit the source code, click 'Save all' and reload the server as desired
